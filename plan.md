# Email Processing Server Development Plan

## Overview
A server application that receives incoming emails, processes them to extract the subject and body, and forwards the data as JSON payloads to designated API endpoints. The server will map incoming email addresses to corresponding API endpoints and structure the data as `{"subjects": [list created from space-delimited subject], "body": email body}`. The service will be built using Go, with email-to-API mappings stored in a SQLite database.

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Create project repository
  - Setup version control (Git)
  - Add README with project overview
  - Create appropriate .gitignore file
- [ ] Configure development environment
  - Setup Go development environment (Go 1.20+)
  - Install necessary development tools and linters (golint, gofmt)
  - Configure VS Code/GoLand with appropriate plugins
- [ ] Initialize project structure
  - Create directory structure following Go project conventions
  - Set up configuration files
- [ ] Setup dependency management
  - Initialize go.mod and go.sum
  - Install core dependencies using `go get`
- [ ] Configure environment variables management
  - Create .env file for local development
  - Document required environment variables

## 2. Backend Foundation

  - [ ] Implement body text extraction
    - Handle plain text and HTML emails
    - Strip unnecessary headers/footers if needed
  - [ ] Create JSON payload formatter using Go's encoding/json package
- [ ] Email-to-API Routing Module
  - [ ] Design routing mechanism using SQLite database
    - Create CRUD operations for email-to-API mappings in SQLite
  - [ ] Implement dynamic routing based on recipient
  - [ ] Create configuration for static routes
- [ ] API Integration Module
